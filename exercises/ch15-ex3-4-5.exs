# Use spawn_link to start a process, and have that process send a message to the parent and then exit immediately. Meanwhile, sleep for 500 ms in the parent, then receive as many messages as are waiting. Trace what you receive. Does it matter that you werenâ€™t waiting for the notification from the child when it exited?
# 15.4
# Do the same, but have the child raise an exception. What difference do you see in the tracing?
# 15.5
# Repeat the two, changing spawn_link to spawn_monitor.
